# CVE-2020-12432

Affected versions: Collabora CODE <= 4.2.2 Vereign's WOPI API Stored XSS and Insecure permissions (account hijack) - 4.2.2
Affected versions: Collabora CODE <= 4.2.2

The wopi API interface developed by vereign (www.verign.com) and integrated into Collabora CODE's main package is prone to an xss attack and insecure file access permissions. After uploading a document with arbitrary html file, it is possible to steal the localstorage data by providing a specifically crafted link with an XSS redirect to a victim. 

PoC: 

1) Upload document file containing javascript code and intercept
the request through burp (or any other intercepting proxy). Put html
contents within the file, containing an html form and a javascript
sending cookies and local storage user data to a third party domain

2) Access the document via the web application and get the document
access token via the API response at the /wopi/getAccessToken endpoint
 
3) Send the malicious html link to the victim, you may include it in
an iframe or in a forum signature:
 
```
<a href=https://target.com/wopi/files/10/contents?access_token=<token>   >Click here</a>
```
 
4) The victim opens the link and gets redirected to another service
with all his cookies and local storage data sent over to another
network
